# nest-auth-rbac

This project is built with **NestJS** to provide the backend API, using **TypeORM** and **PostgreSQL** as the database.

It features a role- and permission-based authentication system.

API documentation is generated with **Swagger** and can be accessed at `${BACKEND_URL}/api/v1`.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (recommended LTS version)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and Docker Compose
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (comes with Node.js)

## üöÄ Project Overview

This backend implements a robust authentication and authorization system based on roles and permissions. It allows users to register, log in, and securely manage their accounts.

### üîê Key Features

- **Nodemailer Integration**  
  The project leverages [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/) to send transactional emails such as account confirmation and password reset links. This ensures users can verify their accounts and recover access when necessary.

  > ‚úâÔ∏è **Gmail Setup:** You can use your Gmail account to send emails by configuring your Gmail credentials in the `.env` file as shown below.

  ```env
   # Email Service (Gmail via Nodemailer)
   SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   SMTP_PORT=587
   SMTP_USER=your_email@gmail.com
   SMTP_PASS=your_app_password
   SMTP_SERVICE=gmail
  ```

**Cloudinary Integration**  
 The backend integrates with [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) to handle file uploads such as profile images and PDF documents. Uploaded files are securely stored in your Cloudinary account. The system validates file types and sizes before accepting uploads, ensuring only supported formats are allowed (e.g., `jpeg`, `png`, `webp`, `avif`, and `pdf`).

To enable this functionality, sign in to your Cloudinary account and configure the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

```env
 # Cloudinary Credentials
 CLOUDINARY_NAME=your_cloud_name
 CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
 CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

- **Security**  
  All sensitive operations are protected by JWT authentication and permission-based guards, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific resources.

### **[Authentication & Authorization]**

- **JWT Authentication:** Protects endpoints using JWT tokens.
- **Password hashing and validation:** Ensures secure passwords with strict validation rules.
- **Role- and permission-based access control:** Endpoints can validate whether a user has the required permission using custom decorators.
- **Super Admin with full access:** The Super Admin role has full privileges, bypassing permission restrictions when necessary.

### **[User Management]**

- **Create, update, and list users:** Complete endpoints for user management.
- **Profile endpoint:** Allows authenticated users to view and manage their own profile.
- **Status toggling (activate/deactivate):** Suspend or activate users without deleting them.
- **DTO validation:** Ensures consistency and data validation for all operations.

### **[Roles & Permissions]**

- **CRUD for roles and permissions:** Create, update, and list roles and permissions with control.
- **Assign multiple permissions to roles:** Roles can have one or more permissions.
- **Status toggling for roles and permissions:** Activate or suspend a role or permission without deleting it.
- **Super Admin protection:** The Super Admin role cannot be deactivated or modified for security reasons.

### **[Error Handling]**

- **Global exception filter:** Centralizes error handling, avoiding repetitive try/catch blocks in controllers.
- **Standardized API responses:** Consistent response messages improve UX and frontend consistency.

### **[API Documentation]**

- **Swagger integration:** Full API documentation accessible at `/api`.
- **Detailed decorators per endpoint:** Uses decorators like `ApiCreateDoc`, `ApiUpdateDoc`, etc., to standardize documentation.
- **Centralized response messages:** All response messages are managed centrally for easier maintenance and improved UX.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
       git clone https://github.com/Antonio-Conrado/nest-auth-rbac.git your-new-project-name
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
      cd your-new-project-name
   ```

3. After cloning and navigating to the project folder, run the rename script to update all instances of the old project name (`nest-auth-rbac`) with your new project name:

   ```bash
      node rename-project.ts
   ```

   - It is **strongly recommended** to delete the `rename-project.ts` script after running it to prevent confusion or accidental reuse.

- Delete the `.git` folder to start a new Git repository.

  > **Note:**  
  > After deleting the `.git` folder, you should create a new Git repository for your project.

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying the template and updating the values with your own:

   ```bash
      cp .env.template .env
   ```

5. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
      npm i
   ```

6. Start the database using Docker:

   ```bash
      docker compose up -d
   ```

7. Migrations

If you are using migrations, set the environment variable `USE_MIGRATIONS=true`.

If not, set it to `false` and TypeORM will automatically load entities and synchronize the database schema (recommended only for development), so you can skip this step if you prefer automatic synchronization.

- The file `config/data-source.ts` is used for running migrations.
- The file `config/typeorm.config.ts` is used to load entities at runtime in your NestJS application.

This project uses TypeORM migrations to manage database schema changes. You can generate, run, and revert migrations using the following commands:

Generate a new migration:

```
npm run migration:generate <MigrationName>
```

This will create a new migration file in:

src/database/migrations/

Run all pending migrations:

```
npm run migration:run
```

Revert the last executed migration:

```
npm run migration:revert
```

Show the migration status:

```
npm run migration:show
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Important:

When using migrations, the synchronize option in TypeOrmModule must be set to false to prevent automatic schema changes in the database.

synchronize: true should only be used in development if you are not using migrations, as it updates the schema automatically.

8. To run the standard development server:

```bash
   npm run start:dev
```

9. Run the seed to populate test data

Use your preferred API client (e.g., Postman, Insomnia, Thunder Client, etc.) to send a GET request to the following endpoint:

üëâ [`GET http://localhost:3000/api/seed/security`](http://localhost:3000/api/seed/security)

Once completed, you will receive a success message. You can then verify the inserted data using your preferred database management tool.

10. Access the API documentation once the server is running:

üëâ **Swagger UI:** [`${BACKEND_URL}/api`](http://localhost:3000/api)
